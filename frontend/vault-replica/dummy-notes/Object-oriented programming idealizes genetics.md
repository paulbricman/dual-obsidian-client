Just like [[Computer networking idealizes social structures|computer networking idealizes social structures]], so does object-oriented programming idealize [[Genes are if-else clauses|genetics]]. [[Virtual reality renders abstract concepts into tangible objects|Objects]] inherit from each other, [[Carbon chauvinism denies artificial general intelligence|just like biological individuals]]. There is polymorphism, just like with [[Genes are like recipes for proteins|genes]]. However, abstract classes which can't have instance themselves is somewhat counterintuitive in the genetic metaphor.
