In light of this, repeated text-based image generation using written language (e.g. books, articles, papers) can greatly increase reading speed. Such a system would turn paragraphs into movie-like scene sequences. This joins [[Computer vision enables visual mnemonic mining|visual mnemonic mining]] in applications of generative models in learning. What's more this approach would leverage [[Multi-modal representations foster understanding|the benefits of learning multi-modal representations]].
