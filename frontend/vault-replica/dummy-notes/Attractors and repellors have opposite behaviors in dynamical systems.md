In a [[Continuous-state dynamical systems share a common structure|dynamical systems]], attractors are states surrounded by [[Memeplexes resemble grativational attractors|basins]] which [[Profit-based information landscapes are debilitating for their inhabitants|nudge]] all [[Phenomenal space is adaptive|trajectories]] towards them. In contrast, repellors are states surrounded by regions which divert all trajectories away. Generally, attractors are [[Structural stability describes basin of similar dynamical systems|stable]], while repellors are not.
