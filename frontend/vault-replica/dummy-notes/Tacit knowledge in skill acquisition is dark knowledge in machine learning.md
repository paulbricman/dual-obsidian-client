In machine learning, dark knowledge refers to a trained model's [[Commonsense is a causal model repository|intuition]] being captured in [[Latent-variable architecture enables data augmentation through hidden state modulation|expressed uncertainty]]. It seems that using this expert model intuition as the object of optimization is extremely effective in training a new model on the task. The expert-related error signal provides a rich constraint which forces the new model into internalizing the expert's intuition, [[Tacit knowledge in skill acquisition is dark knowledge in machine learning|just like in tacit knowledge]]. However, one might argue that machine learning models have access to the very "thoughts" of the expert during distillation.
