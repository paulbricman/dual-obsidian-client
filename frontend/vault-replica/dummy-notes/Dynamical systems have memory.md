[[Dynamical systems have a certain anatomy|Dynamical systems]], both [[Continuous-state dynamical systems share a common structure|continuous-state]] and [[Finite-state dynamical systems are diverse|finite-state]] ones, exhibit [[Memory is perception of structural artifacts|memory]]. This is due to the fact that the current location in [[Dynamical systems have a certain anatomy|state space]] is [[Momentum in optimization is trend observation in retrospective futurism|influenced by all previous locations]]. [[Recurrent networks approximate dynamical systems|Recurrent neural networks]] use this memory in resolving [[Short-long term is a spectrum for memory|short-term dependencies]], especially in [[LSTMs mitigate RNN issues|LSTMs]].
