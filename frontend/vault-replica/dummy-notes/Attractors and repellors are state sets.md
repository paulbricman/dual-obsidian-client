[[Attractors and repellors have opposite behaviors in dynamical systems|Attractors and repellors]] can be expressed as [[Sum of elements represents their set in hyperdimensional computing|sets]]. They are sets of [[Dynamical systems have a certain anatomy|states]] in which a [[Continuous-state dynamical systems share a common structure|dynamical system]] either always finds itself or never does so after an infinite number of [[Tense logic formalizes time|steps]] when starting off from a [[Bifurcations segment space of dynamical systems in basins|basin]].
