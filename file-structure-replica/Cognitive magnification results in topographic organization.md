The visual cortex exhibits retinotopy, with different early areas being involved in processing different parts of the field of view, with larger ones devoted to the fovea. [[Retinal imagery idiosyncracy highlights neural regularity mining|Despite this non-linear regularity, the world is perceived as coherent]]. The somatosensory cortex exhibits [[Motor cortex magnifies by function, not structure|homoncular organization guided by function]]. The auditory cortex exhibits tonotopy, with different early areas being involved in processing different frequency bands, with larger areas devoted to more relevant bands (e.g. human speech). This [[Perception and motor action distort spatial representation|systematic distortion driven by cognitive magnification might provide building blocks of conceptual non-linearity]]. The process of cognitive magnification might also highlight the various levels of [[Brain is like hardware, mind is like software|computation]] required for processing different features.
