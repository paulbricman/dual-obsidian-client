Place electrodes designed for picking up muscle activity around the articulatory organs, near the neck and the mouth, and record activity while the person is conducting subvocalization. Next, you can train a machine learning model to recognize speech from the weak muscle activity associated with covert speech. Electromyography can enable an intimate channel of interaction with a virtual assistant.
