In default logic, an extension is the result of properly applying a series of defaults. Extensions are defined as [[Cognitive dissonance reduction drive influences body state|coherent sets of beliefs about the world, generated]] through default reasoning. However, [[World models reflect ideological structures|real world models appear much more complex]] than the expressivity of default logic allows.
