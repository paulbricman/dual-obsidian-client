Both representationism in cognitive science and adaptationism in evolutionary biology argue that the individual is evolved for gaining an optimal fit on the environment. Representationism argues that the individual evolved to optimally "recover" physical properties of the environment, while adaptationism argues that it evolved to be optimally adapted to its ecology. However, both of these views seem to be limited, and arguments against them appear eerily analogous. There seems to be a tight mutually-informing loop between the individual environment, picked up as enaction in cognitive science and selectivism in evolutionary biology.
