Even if [[Recovery and matching provide self-supervised signals|context provides important feedback signals]], dictionaries might also be useful candidates for [[Concept learning is few-shot scaffolding supported by working memory|concept learning]]. In essence, if a machine learning model is trained to predict the word embedding from its definitions, it could then be used to locate new concepts in semantic space based on their definitions. This way, dictionary definitions enable one-shot concept learning in both humans and machines.
