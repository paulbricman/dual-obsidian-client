When considering a space with an extremely high number of dimensions, it might suffice to selectively sample from a subset of dimensions for [[Manifolds formalize emergence|defining an expressive manifold]]. The resulting dimensionality of the manifold be lower than the one of selective sampling. An instance of this might render neural interfaces feasible, where reading from a subset of critical neurons might bring advanced imaging into our technological reach, as argued by Greg Egan in his short story titled "Learning To Be Me".
