Jackendoff argues that awareness is losely connected to an objective world in that it is informed by it. However, he argues that awareness is also only losely connected to a subjective world of thought, in that we're often not aware of our thought process, or at least part of it. In doing so, Jackendoff creates a somewhat enactive alternative approach to the subject-object dichotomy.
