In his short story titled "Safe-deposit Box", Greg Egan portrays an individual undergoing [[Elderly scaffold neural circuits to compensate for cognitive decline|a progressive decay of brain tissue]]. The story describes how his consciousness, in a resourceful attempt to persist, manages to unconsciously negotiate time spent in the bodies of other individuals. The "Safe-deposit Box" depicts [[Cognitive dissonance reduction drive influences body state|an extreme case of phychological resilience]] through an individual whose consciousness jumps regularly from individual to individual around his body.
