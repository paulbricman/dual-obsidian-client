Many argue that non-linear notes should be densely linked. The dense linking constraints might force the learner to articulate [[Explicit position cues describe conceptual structure|explicit position cues]] in conceptual space, which might [[Concept learning is few-shot scaffolding supported by working memory|foster understanding]]. What's more, a densely linked structure also makes it easy for subsequent viewers to internalize the concept, similarly to how [[Explicit position cues describe conceptual structure|analogies]] or [[Dictionary definitions enable one-shot concept learning|definitions]] would.
