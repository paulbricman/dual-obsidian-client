There's more to an interface than a physical boundary between two agents interacting. A space can also act as an interface between an agent and a community (e.g. stadium), between an agent and a behavior (e.g. kitchen), or between an agent and a thought (e.g. library). Architecture expands interaction beyond the narrow view of human-computer interaction.
