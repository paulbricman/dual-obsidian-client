The perception of movement through space can decrease the level of bodily stress one experiences. If autonomic arousal was evolutionarily engineered to "get us moving", then it only make sense for movement to bring stress levels down, essentially signaling that stress was already effective.

EMDR exapts the optic flow destressing mechanism.
