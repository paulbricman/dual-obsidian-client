The [[Second brain has a cognitive architecture|second brain architecture]] closely resembles modern human cognitive architectures. For instance, [[Fluid search output resembles working memory|fluid search output resembles working memory]], [[Second brain contents resemble long-term memory|non-linear contents resemble long-term memory]], and [[Second brain buffer is like short-term memory|a transient buffer resembles short-term memory]]. This high-fidelity alignment can enable a functional dialogue through [[Second brain architecture guides cognitive augmentation|guidelines for cognitive augmentation]].
