In software development related to augmented reality, cloud anchors are textual identifiers for places in space. By using cloud anchors, developers can engineer AR apps which enable shared experiences with multiple users. Just like cloud anchors provide an identifier for a certain scene, place cells in the brain code for a certain place. The metaphor between cloud anchors and place cells bridges software engineering and cognitive neuroscience.
