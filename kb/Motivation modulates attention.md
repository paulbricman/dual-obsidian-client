A prospective reward associated with a stimuli can boost one's sensitivity to that stimuli. This can be achieved by [[Extrinsic reward dependence is unsustainable|artificially associating a class of stimuli with a reward]] and monitoring the deployment of attention to different stimuli. Through the substraction paradigm, neural correlates of reward expectation can be identified.
