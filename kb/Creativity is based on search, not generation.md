One intuitively conceives creativity as the process of creation. However, creativity can also be seen as the process of intuitively ignoring the multitude of possible ways to go, and wisely choosing one path forward. The painter eventually painted one painting, not a billion other possible ones. The sculptor carved the block of stone in this particular way, not in one of the alternative myriad of ways. Creativity is fundamentally a search process, a foraging process. This is especially clear in machine-based creativity.
