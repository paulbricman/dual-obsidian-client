To an unsupervised language model (or rather, a [[Recovery and matching provide self-supervised signals|self-supervised one]]), human languages are as foreign as non-human languages. Therefore, unsupervised language models could potentially be used in helping people understand non-human languages, such as languages used by non-human animals or extraterrestrial civilizations.
