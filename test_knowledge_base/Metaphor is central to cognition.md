Metaphor can readily be seen as something much more central to thought than a colorful figure of speech in literature. Metaphorical thought helps us find "parallels", not only among concepts, but even between concepts and sensorimotor modalities. The concept of conceptual parallel is itself a metaphor (matching patterns of relation), as is metaphor itself ("carrying over", like a bridge). At the extreme, Hofstadter, Lakoff, and Johnson argue that metaphor based on embodiment is central to child development, abstract reasoning, and everything in between. In their view, cross-domain projection of invariant mental models is key to general intelligence.
